This repository contains an example of a common error in Python: a RecursionError caused by a faulty recursive function. The `factorial.py` file shows the buggy code, while `factorialSolution.py` provides a corrected version.  The bug arises from the lack of a base case to handle negative input which leads to infinite recursion.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle this edge case and prevent the error.
